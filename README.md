# The-Tech-Academy-Basic-C-Sharp-Projects
This repository will contain my code for the upcomming projects, assingments and assesments.

These are some projets I made using c# and .NET Framework:

 ConsoleMaths 
 This code is part of a simple console app called MathOperationApp, built to show how basic programming concepts work in C#. It defines a class with a method that takes two numbers, doubles the first one, and prints both to the screen. In the Main method, an object of the class is created and the method is called twice using both positional and named parameters. The program concludes by waiting for user input before closing, allowing the user to view the output.

InsuranceQuoteApp
The InsuranceQuoteApp is a web appliction, which allows users fill out a form to get a car insurance quote based on their age, car details, driving history, and coverage type. Here, I designed a model called Insuree with fields like name, birthdate, car make/model, and more, all with validation rules. In the controller, logic is used to calculate a custom insurance quote by adding charges for risk factors (like speeding tickets, DUI, or a Porsche) and saving the result to a database. The app includes views for users to submit their info and for admins to see all submitted quotes in a table.

Package Express
This console application simulates a shipping quote tool for Package Express, guiding the user through inputting package weight and dimensions. It checks whether the package is too heavy or too large to be shipped and ends the program early if it doesnâ€™t meet the criteria. If the package is acceptable, it calculates a shipping quote using a basic formula based on volume and weight. Finally, it displays the estimated cost and thanks the user for using the service.
